My first React App

A movie database where users are able to search for films and view said films' information.

Users are also able to register and add films to a watchlist.

Currently users are not able to remove a film from the watchlist from the movie info page. 

CINEFLIX was utilized so I could learn and implement my own functionalities into the project.

TMDB and OMDB APIs are utilized.

Please feel free to contribute to the project!
