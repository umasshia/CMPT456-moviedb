My first React App

A movie database where users are able to search for films and view said films' information.

Users are also able to register and add films to a watchlist.

Currently users are not able to remove a film from the watchlist from the movie info page. 

CINEFLIX was utilized app so I could learn and implement my own functionalities into the project, although its functionalities and code was heavily modified.

TMDB and OMDB APIs are utilized.

Please feel free to contribute to the project!
